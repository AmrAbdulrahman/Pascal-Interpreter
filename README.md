# Simple Code

> A platform where kids can learn programming in a simple and attractive way

Project milestones:
- [x] Build an interpreter that defines a new programming language. the purpose behind this language is to have a very simple, very readable and intutive programming language
  - [x] variable declarations
  - [x] function declarations
  - [x] function invokations
  - [x] if, else if, otherwise
  - [x] logical comparisons `equals`, `not equals`, `less|greater than`, `and`, `or`
- [x] Build a simpe react application around that interpreter
- [x] Read code from a textbox, interpret it, and print either errors or output.
- [ ] Add a descent online code editor the application
- [ ] Add custom syntax highlighting that matches our keywords
- [ ] Refine the language syntax
  - [ ] loops: `for`, `while`, and `do-while`
  - [ ] `classes` and `objects`
  - [ ] `arrays`
- [ ] Read input from the users
- [ ] Enable debugging mode, or let's call it a `step-by-step` execution
- [ ] Visualize the memory at runtime
- [ ] Visualize the call stack
